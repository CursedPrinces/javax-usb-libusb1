o Consider adding an "closed" check to all methods.
  It will never fail unless objects are explicitly closes(), which they're not if a user
  is sticking strictly to the javax.usb interface. However, making the JVM abort is not
  fun if the object for some reason has been closed() and then referenced.

  Are there any major performance overhead with this checking?
