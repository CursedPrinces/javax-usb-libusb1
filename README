Technical Implementation Details

The device and handle references are stored internally in the Device and Interface classes
as integers. These should be byte arrays to be a bit more generic.

To control the debugging level from libusb set the system property
"javax.usb.libusb.debug" to the desired level:

 -Djavax.usb.libusb.debug=3

See their documentation for the up to date values. Current values:

 Level 0: no messages ever printed by the library (default)
 Level 1: error messages are printed to stderr
 Level 2: warning and error messages are printed to stderr
 Level 3: informational messages are printed to stdout, warning and error
          messages are printed to stderr

To trace all calls to libusb, truss/strace/kdump style set the system property
"javax.usb.libusb.trace" to true

 -Djavax.usb.libusb.trace=true
