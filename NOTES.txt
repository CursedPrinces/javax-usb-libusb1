= Implementation Notes =

Right now there's a whole lot of libusb_open() and libusb_close() going on. I
wonder if that has a big impact on anything. If it has I have to find a way to
associate a handle with a device or something. However, as there are no
close() operations on a device it's kinda hard to know when to release the
handle.

= TCK Notes =

 * The TCK should not assert if a method is synchronized or not.
 * The TCK should not assert private methods. They are PRIVATE.

Stuff I know I don't do properly that the TCK should catch:

 * When closing a parent object (like a UsbDevice) it should implicitly close
   all child objects (like any UsbPipes that are open).
